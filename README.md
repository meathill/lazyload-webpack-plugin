lazyload-webpack-plugin
========

A webpack plugin for adding `loading="lazy"`into all `&lt;img>` in HtmlWebpackPlugin pages.

Currently it **DOES NOT** support any other lazyload methods. I will add them in the future. 

Note: This is an extension plugin for [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin),
and only work with html-webpack-plugin@4+.

Introduction
--------

As @addyosmani said in his twitter,

> Native &lt;img&gt; lazy-loading is coming to the web! [https://t.co/LgF7F1iMgR](https://t.co/LgF7F1iMgR") &lt;img loading=lazy&gt; defers offscreen images until the user scrolls near them. Shipping in Chrome ~75 [https://t.co/4gR7lvx4zx](https://t.co/4gR7lvx4zx)

Chrome will support `loading="lazy"` in `<img>` to turn on native lazy-load.
Then I think I can do this via a webpack plugin, adding this attribute to all `<img>`s.

Pre-requisites  
--------

This module requires Webpack@4+, and html-webpack-plugin@4+.

Next, use it in your Webpack config:

    new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
